I used to hack on PHP and I am a newbie on developing something with Ruby on Rails or with Ruby itself. Well, it doesn't mean that a newbie doesn't know anything about a specific topic right? So I will be sharing you what Ruby on Rails is, where it came from, and I will also be sharing to you how I started to learn Ruby/RoR as a newbie. And hopefully I can find time to teach you how to get started with Ruby on Rails development. So watch out for that.

###What is Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is an open-source web application framework created by David Heinemeier Hansson. Rails is based on the <b>Model-View-Controller</b> architecture that splits your application into three sections: 

* The <b>Models</b> are the ones which contains the business data and behaviour.
* The <b>Views</b> are templates which renders data from the model to the user. So basically, it is what the user sees from the screen.
* The <b>Controllers</b> process the request from users and it also initiate changes in the models.

Many says that Rails is an <b>"opinionated software"</b> which means it only focuses on one way of doing things. Unlike PHP which gives you different ways to solve one problem. Well, I don't know if that's a good feature of Rails. What do you think?

Anyway, where did RoR came from?

###The Ruby Programming Language

Yes! The name already tells. It came from a programming language named as "Ruby".

Ruby is developed in 1995 by a Japanese programmer named Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a. "Matz". 

Matz took some elements from his favorite programming languages which are Perl, Smalltalk and Lisp. He combined them all into one language with easy syntax and the Ruby language was born. I'll talk more about the syntax of Ruby and some more important things about it on my next post. So stay tuned.

###Being a Ruby newbie

As you know, I've been developing with PHP for many years now. And yeah, I've been hearing Ruby before. And it was until last month that Ruby touched my heart. Since then, I've started to learn Ruby. But I struggled on learning it because I don't know where to start. And I hope I can help you (newbies) to start learning Ruby and RoR.

####The core language

Ruby is the core of everything you'll do on Ruby on Rails. Ruby is the language and Rails is the framework you use to make your development faster and easier. 

So study the Ruby programming language first before moving on to studying Rails.

####Where to start?

To get started with learning Ruby, you can checkout [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/). And if you want an interactive learning, you can go to [http://tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org) and [Ruby Monk](http://rubymonk.com).

And for Rails, I am using [Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s courses for it.

###Conclusion
I hope I was able to show you a very short introduction on Rails development. On my next post, we will try to install Ruby and Ruby on Rails on your machine and the basics of Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
